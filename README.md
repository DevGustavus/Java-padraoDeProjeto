## üìñ About the project
This project from the Santander Bootcamp | Fullstack Developer at DIO aims to deepen the understanding and application of design patterns in the BackEnd. By implementing the Factory and Strategy patterns, it seeks to provide a flexible interface for object creation and the ability to dynamically choose specific algorithms at runtime. The Factory pattern simplifies the creation of different types of objects, while the Strategy pattern allows the dynamic exchange of algorithms, promoting cohesion and facilitating system maintenance. This project represents a valuable opportunity to enhance skills in BackEnd design patterns, resulting in a more flexible and sustainable architecture.
